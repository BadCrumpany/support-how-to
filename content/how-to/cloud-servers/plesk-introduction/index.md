Ples&reg;k is a Licensed GUI based hosting solution for use on Rackspace Dedicated servers/Virtual Machines running RHEL&reg; or CentOS&reg;. 

It allows customers to have a convenient way to manage their websites and website content while requiring minimal 
Linux command line experience. Plesk fully controls the server's web server operations and reverts most changes made outside of 
the Plesk panel directly related to the webserver. 

As such, there are specific guidelines and methods for working with Plesk. Through the Plesk panel,  
you can add/remove websites, add/remove SSL certificates, and modify hosting settings with a few clicks.


### Prerequisites

   - Dedicated server/Virtual Machine running RHEL or CentOS
   - Plesk Obsidian or later

### Accessing the Plesk interface

**Note:** replace `123.4.567.8` or `example.com` in the URLs below to your server IP address or hostname.

```
https://123.4.567.8:8443
```
```
https://example.com:8443
```

You can also generate a single-use login link. It will be necessary to generate a new login link each time.

1. Connect to the server via SSH. [Mac OS X](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-mac-os-x-by-using-terminal) [Windows](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-windows-by-using-putty)
2. Run the following command to create a single use login link:
   ``` 
        # plesk login
        
        https://example.com:8443/login?secret=dEdJc3GJWkK%2FmPWrMvCPfAd1CWzQQY0oVkwzJze
        https://123.4.567.8:8443/login?secret=dEdJc3GJWkK%2FmPWrMvCPfAd1CWzQQY0oVkwzJze 
    ```
3. Input the login link to the browser. This will automatically log in to the Plesk interface.
4. Due to some network configurations, the log in link might be generated for the private IP of the device. If this occurs, replace the private IP with the public IP for your login link.
