Error 500 is a generic error that basically means there is something wrong with
the website server, however, it doesn't provide further information. It's a sign that someone will
need to log into the server and troubleshoot and investigate the issue.

There can be serveral issues that could cause this error, most of the time it
means server-side problems:

1. Permissions on website content files or folders.
2. Issues with `.htaccess` file.
3. Scripting errors.
4. Specific errors with the CMS (Wordpress&reg;, Magento&reg;).
