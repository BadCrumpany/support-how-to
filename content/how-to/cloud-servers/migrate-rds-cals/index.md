This article describes the steps to migrate your Remote Desktop
Services (RDS) Client Access Licenses (CAL's) to another server. Please keep in
mind that you will need administrator permissions to complete this task.

#### Confirm RDS CAL connection method

1. Log in to your new **Remote Desktop License Server**.
2. Navigate to **Administrative Tools** > **Remote Desktop Licensing Manager**.
3. Expand **All Servers** and right-click on the origin server.
4. Select **Properties** and look for the **Connection method**.
5. Choose the connection method in the drop-down menu or proceed to the
   migration. You will find one of the following three connection methods:
    - **Automatic connection (recommended)**. To perform the migration, the RDS
      License Server communicates directly with the **Microsoft Clearinghouse** over
      outbound TCP port `443`.
    - **Web browser**. This method can be used when the RDS License Server does
      not have internet connectivity. The migration process can be completed by
      an administrator via a browser on a separate device.
    - **Telephone**. This method can be used when internet access is not available
      or communication over the phone is preferred. The migration process can be
      completed over the phone by talking to a Microsoft representative.

#### Migrate RDS CALs

After you have identified the Remote Desktop License Server connection method, complete the migration using the following instructions:

1. Under **Remote Desktop Licensing Manager**, right-click on the origin server
   and select **Manage Licenses**. When the option is greyed out, you may still
   need to active the new License Server.
2. Select **Migrate RDS CALs from another license server to this license
   server** and one of the options below:
    - **The source license server is being replaced by this license server**. If
      you choose this option, you will be asked for the source serverâ€™s IP
      address or hostname. If the server is not available on the network, you
      will need to confirm the Operating System and the license server ID of the
      source server.
    - **The source license server is no longer functioning**. To choose this
      option an Operating System needs to be specified and the license server ID
      of the source server.

        **Note**: If the source server cannot be contacted, you need to confirm
        that you will remove the RDS CALs manually from the source license
        server after the wizard has completed.

3. After completion, you will be directed to **Obtain Client License Key
   Pack** page.
4. Complete the migration according to the connection method:

- **Automatic connection method**
  - On the **License Program Page**, select the program used to purchase the RDS
    license.
  - Fill out the agreement number, license code or license number.
  - Follow the wizard and the server will automatically connect to Microsoft
    Clearinghouse to complete your request.

- **Web browser method**
  - Follow the link on the **Obtain Client License Key Pack** page (the link can
      be used on any device with internet connectivity).
  - On the website, navigate to **Select Option** > **Manage CALs**.
  - Fill in the required information, such as license program, reason for
      migration and your company information.
  - Provide the agreement number, license code or license number provided after purchase.
  - You will be provided with a **license key pack ID**.
  - Enter the **license key pack ID** on your new RDS license server to complete
      the migration.

- **Telephone method**
  - Call the number listed on the **Obtain Client License Key Pack** page.
  - Provide the information regarding your license program to the Microsoft
    Representative.
  - Upon completion, the representative will give you a **license key pack ID**.
  - Enter the ID on the new RDS license server to complete migration.
